It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas\\' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like \"dressed-up midgets\" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother\\'s slow awakening to what\\'s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they\\'d all be \"up\" for this movie.'"

            " b'years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what a terrible film it s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn t sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director s cut or in this case let s salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don t know what s going on or why we re watching what s going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone s death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there s no catalyst in this story br br one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it s no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie s mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird s eye view of julie running towards hudson s plane is another wink at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence i m like what happened here br br the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where s peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that s one slow moving train there br br the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it s effect is diminished considerably because it s repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man s land is ok even if it s bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying br br the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she s on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she s no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute br br how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release'\n",
            " b'this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen i love japanese movies and i think another film by the same director electric dragon 80 000 v is a masterpiece i really wanted to like this movie asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing but i couldn t find anything entertaining about it br br the movie takes forever for nothing to happen and the effects the director used like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn t worship anything this added nothing to the plot a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly we couldn t believe this film was as terrible as it was and the finale was awful i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this but sadly i was mistaken'\n",

            " b'honestly this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen partly because it takes itself so seriously as opposed to regular light hearted trash this movies wants you to be emotionally involved to feel for the characters and to care about the alleged conspiracy none of this ever even comes close to happening br br mild spoilers br br there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1 incoherent and totally non sensical plot 2 annoying style over substance mtv camerawork 3 moronic characters and plot holes br br allow me to elaborate br br 1 apparently when this movies was being made they couldn t decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies the stigmata or possession so guess what they combined them an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained nor even talked about now instead of just saying what he wants to say he gives her the stigmata why why not just spit it out instead we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices carving cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on walls apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters while talking in that cliched harsh possessed voice that we all have heard countless times this also starts to tie into my second complaint because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake why does this happen who knows my guess is that the director thought it looked cool br br 2 this movies contains dozens of shots in slow motion of course of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off and most annoyingly of water dripping this woman s apartment is constantly dripping water constantly logically the place would probably fall apart with this many holes to sum up this complaint towards the end and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts to shots of water dripping in slow motion in reverse why i have no idea it has no relevance to anything and once again i m betting it s because the director thought it looked cool br br 3 one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science this doesn t make sense to me i would think that going to church would be enough but no he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest i just don t buy it secondly there are lots of plot holes a few of which i will elaborate on below for starters when she first gets the stigmata the scene ends with her laying unconscious bleeding next she s in the hospital who called the ambulance another one is towards the end when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl he says take me as your messenger not a word for word quote but you get the idea his response you have no faith only doubt so because of this he possesses an aetheist an aetheist has no faith far less then any scientific priest and then there s the fact that the object of this movie s conspiracy this lost gospel of st thomas i believe is available at local bookstores the characters are willing to kill to supress this document but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history where it isn t wide known but the movie never tries to tell us this or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document s uncovering br br in closing this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree it is my arch nemesis which i feel the need to insult every chance i get i loathe it final grade f'\n",

            " b'the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always reliably returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isn t the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity but it s still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make up effects although courtesy of a young stan winston are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the film s title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat cave and a bat mobile a stolen ambulance the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon weekend exploring caves they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal s vicious attack worried that he might be infected with rabies he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesn t prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat guano so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolf theme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy there s a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring film s current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldn t feel and traditional without the bat people'\n",

            " b'another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february 1943 the details are given in an addendum that follows this review br br the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter s non jewish fianc leave the house br br the distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now 90 hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat br br the film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at 33 played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse site br br the narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones br br the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinema s most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress br br the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive br br rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction br br the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating 8 10 b seen on 05 31 05 if you d like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites br br add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse 2 4 a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlin br br because these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied poland br br normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbers br br perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reich br br joseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation s public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women s actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitler s concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz br br to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teacher s guide to the holocaust'\n",

            " b'office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick br br the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right

            " b'once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent reuniting with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of blandness action comedy mostly just doesn t work part of the problem is the casting chris klien as a former action hero he s not bad but he s really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he s not bad he s just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn t funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power br br i can t really recommend the film its worth a shot if you re a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment'\n",
            " b'this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like vancouver s rise to prominance the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon br br i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the boy band craze after all both n sync and the backstreet boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written br br also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the concert scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don t seem to move the story along in any way br br i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn t his strong suit but its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he s infamous not famous br br'\n",

            " b'comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times chappelle s show the daily show colbert report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr katz then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful mencia and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny colbert report but can be horrible mind of mencia it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn t funny a woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that s common we don t need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is disarmed by a queef it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were hotter and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the absurdist comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a fantastical realist view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i m very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should ve never made it past the unaired pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show'\n",
